## Hello, there ðŸ¥°

<p>Welcome to my spaceðŸ¤—<p> 

I'm Roseline Bassey, a technical communicator, RESTAPI specialist, an open source enthusiast, public speaker, community builder and a certified Tech101 trainer.
I founded Youth Skill Hub, a Facebook community that connects young people to yhe resouces, internships, and training they need to start a career in tech. 

I'm an English major. My academic experience has helped in my knowledge of using plain language to explain technical jargons or concepts in a fun and exciting way a lay man would understand.
